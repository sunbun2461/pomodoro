# Pomodoro Clock that integrated with SQL and Perl

## Overview

This is a pomodoro clock that I am making to actually help myself. I am also making it to acclimate with perl and sql. I will then make migrate the app to python/django.



Using Perl together with SQLite for a web application, like the Pomodoro timer you're describing, is entirely doable and can be an excellent way to manage server-side logic and data persistence. However, integrating Perl directly within JavaScript (JS) or HTML pages isn't the typical approach. Instead, you would use Perl as part of the backend to handle HTTP requests, process data, and interact with the SQLite database. Then, the frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) communicates with this backend through HTTP requests, as you've started to outline with your fetch API call to `script.cgi`.

Here's an overview of how this could work:

### Backend (Perl and SQLite)

1. **Perl CGI Script**: Your `script.cgi` would be a Perl script that can insert, update, delete, or retrieve tasks from an SQLite database based on the request it receives. This script would be executed by your web server (like Apache or Nginx configured with CGI support) when a request is made to its URL.

2. **SQLite Database**: SQLite would store the tasks and their related data (description, start time, etc.). Perl would use DBI (Database Interface) and DBD::SQLite (a DBI driver for SQLite) modules to interact with the database.

### Frontend (HTML/JS)

- Your JavaScript would make HTTP requests to the Perl script to send or retrieve data, updating the UI based on the responses received.
- The frontend would be responsible for handling user interactions, such as starting the timer, displaying the remaining time, and showing or hiding the break modal.

### Integration Steps

1. **Setup Perl Environment**: Install Perl and necessary modules (`CGI`, `DBI`, `DBD::SQLite`) on your server.

2. **Create SQLite Database**: Define your schema (as you've outlined) and initialize your SQLite database with the necessary tables.

3. **Develop Perl Script**: Write a CGI script in Perl that can handle different types of requests (e.g., POST to add a new task, GET to retrieve tasks). This script interacts with the SQLite database to perform CRUD operations.

4. **Configure Web Server**: Setup your web server to handle CGI scripts, directing requests to your Perl script correctly.

5. **Implement Frontend Logic**: Use JavaScript to make requests to your Perl script and update the UI accordingly. Your existing code snippet for the Pomodoro timer would be part of the frontend.

6. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: If your frontend and backend are served from different origins, you'll need to handle CORS in your Perl script to allow these requests.

### Perl and JavaScript Interaction

While Perl code doesn't go directly into JS or HTML, they interact through HTTP requests:
- JavaScript sends data to Perl scripts using AJAX (`fetch` API in your case).
- The Perl script processes this data (e.g., saving it to a database) and responds back.
- JavaScript then processes the response (e.g., updating the UI).

This separation is part of the client-server model, where Perl acts as the server-side language, and JavaScript is used for client-side scripting.

### Extending Functionality

As for adding features like login, you can continue to use Perl and SQLite. You'd implement authentication and session management on the Perl side. This involves creating a new table for user accounts, handling login requests, and managing session tokens or cookies to keep users logged in.

In summary, integrating Perl with a web application for tasks like a Pomodoro timer and future features is not only doable but a solid approach for learning and applying server-side programming concepts.
